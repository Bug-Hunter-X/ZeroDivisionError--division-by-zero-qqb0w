# ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
This repository demonstrates a common Python error: `ZeroDivisionError`.  The code attempts to divide by zero, which causes the error. The solution demonstrates how to handle potential `ZeroDivisionError` exceptions using a `try-except` block. 

## Bug
The `bug.py` file contains a function that attempts to divide by zero.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.py` file provides a solution to prevent the `ZeroDivisionError` by using a `try-except` block.
